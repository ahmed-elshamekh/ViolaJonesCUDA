To run our Viola-Jones program on a gpulabXX machine, the simplest way is to execute ./run.sh, which will (by default) detect the 29 faces in the Solvay conference image provided (Face.pgm), print the coordinates of each face, and draw white boxes around the detected faces on the image output.pgm, which can be viewed with eog. Timing data will also be printed to stdout at the end of the invocation; this can be toggled with the #define TIME_DETECTION flag in main.cpp.
